  <p>Anything that you create conveys a message.  If it's good, it conveys the message you want.  If it's great, it tells the story you want, as well.</p>

  <p>If it does all of these things, and then causes someone to do something back, it's actionable.  We only make actionable work.</p>

  <p>On the web, action means links.  Our links all have <a class="link link-inline" href="https://vimeo.com/8266133" target="_blank">this</a> treatment.  It's a way to communicate that something will happen when you interact with that element.</p>
