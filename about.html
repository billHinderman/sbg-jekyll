<h2>About Bill Hinderman.</h2>
<p><a class="link" href="http://billhinderman.com" target="_blank">Bill</a> is the Senior Site Optimization UI Engineer at Orbitz Worldwide. In human terms: I’ve built our A/B testing development practice from the ground up. Our team focuses on experimenting and optimizing across all product verticals that Orbitz offers while simultaneously accelerating and training specific product teams to do the same.</p>

<p>I’m also the author of Building Responsive Data Visualization for the Web, a book on the processes of building code-driven data visualization upon the principles of responsive web design.</p>

<p>I fly to different cities as often as I can to talk about the future of web development, data visualization, and cross-platform design.</p>
